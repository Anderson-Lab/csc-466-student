## Excercises 8-???
While the Marsland book avoids using another popular package called Pandas, we will use it at times throughout this course. Please read and study [10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) before proceeding to any of the exercises below.


## Exercise 8
Repeat exercise A.1 from Marsland, but create a Pandas DataFrame instead of a NumPy array.

```python
# YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

## Exercise 9
Repeat exercise A.2 using a DataFrame instead.

```python
# YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

```python
b.values
```

## Exercise 10
Repeat exercise A.3 using DataFrames instead.

```python
# YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

## Exercise 11
Repeat exercise A.7 using a dataframe.

```python
# YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

## Exercises 12-14
Now let's look at a real dataset, and talk about ``.loc``. For this exercise, we will use the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Here is some sample code to read it into a dataframe.

```python
titanic_df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlsun/data-science-book/master/data/titanic.csv"
)
titanic_df
```

```python
titanic_df.index
```

```python
df = titanic_df.set_index('sex').loc['female']
df
```

```python
inxs = np.where(titanic_df.survived==1)
inxs
titanic_df.iloc[inxs]
```

Notice how we have nice headers and mixed datatypes? That is one of the reasons we might use Pandas. Please refresh your memory by looking at the 10 minutes to Pandas again, but then answer the following.


## Exercise 12
How do you select the ``name`` column without using .iloc?

```python
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

## Exercise 13
After setting the index to ``sex``, how do you select all passengers that are ``female``? And how many female passengers are there?

```python
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
titanic_df.set_index('sex',inplace=True)
```

## Exercise 14
How do you reset the index?

```python
titanic_df.reset_index(inplace=True)

```

```python
## YOUR SOLUTION HERE
```

```python

```
