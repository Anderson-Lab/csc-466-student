    "## Preface\n",
    "(Courtesy of Dr. Alex Dekhtyar)\n",
    "\n",
    "The core objective of Knowledge Discovery in Data/Data Mining/Machine Learning methods is to provide efficient algorithms for gaining insight from data. CSC 466 primarily studies the methods and the algorithms that enable\n",
    "such insight, and that specifically take this insight above and beyond traditional statistical analysis of data (more\n",
    "about this — later in the course).\n",
    "However, the true power of KDD/DM/ML methods that we will study in this course is witnessed only when\n",
    "these methods are applied to actually gain insight from the data. As such, in this course, the deliverables for your\n",
    "laboratory assignments will be partitioned into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. KDD Method implementation. In most labs you will be asked to implement from scratch one or more\n",
    "KDD method for producing a special type of insight from data. This part of the labs is similar to your other\n",
    "CS coursework - you will submit your code, and, sometimes, your tests and/or output.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Insight, a.k.a., data analysis. For each lab assignment we will provide one or more datasets for your\n",
    "perusal, and will ask you to perform the analysis of these datasets using the methods you implemented. The\n",
    "results of this analysis, i.e., the insight, are as important for successful completion of your assignments, as\n",
    "your implementations. Most of the time, you will be asked to submit a lab report detailing your analysis,\n",
    "and containing the answers to the questions you are asked to study.\n",
    "The insight portion of your deliverables is something that you may be seeing for the first time in your CS\n",
    "coursework. It is not an afterthought in your lab assignments. Your grade will, in no small part, depend on\n",
    "the results of your analysis, and the writing quality on your report. This lab assignment, and further assignments\n",
    "will include detailed insturctions on how to prepare reports, and we will discuss report writing several times as\n",
    "the course progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pair programming assignment. I strongly\n",
    "discourage individual work for this (and other team/pair programming) lab(s), even if you think you can do it\n",
    "all by yourself. Also, this is a pair programming assignment, not a ”work in teams of two” assignment. Pair\n",
    "programming requires joint work on all aspects of the project without delegating portions of the work to individual\n",
    "1\n",
    "team members. For this lab, I want all your work — discussion, software development, analysis of the results,\n",
    "report writing — to be products of joint work.\n",
    "Students enrolled in the class can pair with other students enrolled in the class. Students on the waitlist can\n",
    "pair with other students on the waitlists. In the cases of ”odd person out” situations, a team of three people can\n",
    "be formed, but that team must (a) ask and answer one additional question, and (b) work as a pair would, without\n",
    "delegation of any work off-line."

    "For this lab, we are going to implement a variation of the C4.5 decision tree with statistical pruning. C4.5 provides several improvements over ID3 though the base structure is very similar. Note that there are different methods for pruning a decision tree. Here we will use statistical confidence intervals. If you have trouble getting started, don't forget Marsland has sample code on his website that corresponds to the book.\n",

    "Now we can put together a pruning algorithm. Please implement statistical pruning, but here a short description of reduced-error pruning as well. Original source of some text: [http://www.cs.bc.edu/~alvarez/ML/statPruning.html](http://www.cs.bc.edu/~alvarez/ML/statPruning.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduced-Error Pruning**: One approach to pruning is to withhold a portion of the available labeled data for validation. The validation set is not used during training. Once training has been completed, testing is carried out over the validation set. If the error rate of the original decision tree over the validation set exceeds the error rate of a pruned version of the tree (obtained by replacing a near-leaf node with its child leaves by a single leaf node), then the pruning operation is carried out. Reduced error pruning can reduce overfitting, but it also reduces the amount of data available for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Pruning**: C4.5 uses a pruning technique based on statistical confidence estimates. This technique has the advantage that it allows all of the available labeled data to be used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of the statistical pruning technique is the calculation of a confidence interval for the error rate. In brief, one starts from an observed error rate f measured over the set of N training instances. In order to decide whether to replace a near-leaf node and its child leaves by a single leaf node, C4.5 compares the upper limits of the error confidence intervals for the two trees. For the unpruned tree, the upper error estimate is calculated as a weighted average over its child leaves (what you implemented above). Whichever tree has a lower estimated upper limit on the error rate \"wins\" and is selected.\n",
